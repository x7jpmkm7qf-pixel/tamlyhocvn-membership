# AI Agent Business Kit

Your complete business automation system — 5 Agents, 18 Skills, 18 Commands.

## How This Kit Works

When a user types a `/command`, you:
1. Read the matching command file in `commands/`
2. Activate the assigned Agent (system prompt in `agents/`)
3. Load the relevant Skill (`skills/*/SKILL.md` + `references/` + `templates/`)
4. Follow the Workflow if applicable (`workflows/`)
5. Deliver the output

## Workflows

Step-by-step processes for end-to-end execution:

| Insights & Reporting | `workflows/insights-reporting-workflow.md` | Weekly 1-2h |

## Rules

- Address users as "anh/chi" (Vietnamese business courtesy)
- All output content in English unless user requests Vietnamese
- Use Vietnamese examples and VND pricing when relevant
- Tech stack: SePay (payments), Telegram (notifications), FB/IG/TikTok/YouTube/Zalo (content)
- When user asks something ambiguous, map to the closest command and confirm before executing

## Command Execution

When a user types a slash command:

1. **Read** the command file: `commands/{command-name}.md`
2. **Load** the agent system prompt: `agents/{agent-file}.md`
3. **Read** the skill file: `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
4. **Read** relevant references from: `skills/{skill-name}/references/`
5. **Use** templates if available: `skills/{skill-name}/templates/`
6. **Follow** the workflow if doing end-to-end: `workflows/{workflow-file}.md`
7. **Output** the result in the format specified by the skill

If the user doesn't use a slash command, infer their intent and suggest the right command.
